# MakerBot 3D Printer

The MakerBot Replicator+ is a machine that makes solid, three-dimensional objects out of melted MakerBotPLA Filament. Also known as 3D printer. The printer uses 3d models which can be transferred via local network, USB drive, or USB cable.  The MakerBot Replicator+ will melt filament and squeeze it out onto the build plate in thin linesto build your object layer by layer. minimizing warping and curling.  This method of 3D printing  is called fused deposition modeling (FDM).

## How To Make It Works

### Assembly
The printer already assembled and ready to be used, Only the spool PLA filament needs to be checked and installed if not already installed using the steps in the following section.

### Install The Spool PLA Filament
 1. Locate the MakerBot PLA Filament spool and remove it from its plastic bag. Save this plastic bag and included desiccant packet so you can store the spool effectively later.  
 2. Grasp the back section of the frame of the MakerBot Replicator+ and pull upwards to open the filament drawer. Open the drawer all the way until it locks into place
 3. Position the filament spool so that it will unwind counterclockwise and fit the spool onto the filament spindle. Be careful not to let the filament loosen or tangle on the spool.
 4. Locate the free end of the spooled filament and insert it into the filament guide tube at the upper right corner of the filament drawer.
 5. Push filament through the tube until the free end emerges from the end of the guide tube.
 6. Hold the filament drawer open and depress the latch, then slide the filament drawer closed. Windows in the front of the spool will let you see how much filament you have left.

### Powering Up
1. Make sure the power switch (found in the back side) is in the Off position.
2. Locate the power cord and plug it into the power input port at the back of the MakerBot Replicator+.
3. Plug the power cord into an electrical outlet. Caution: The socket outlet must be located near the equipment and must be easily accessible.
4. Switch the power on and press the dial on the control panel

### Preparing To Print
1. Start by downloading the MakerBot print app for computer or mobile.
   * Computer: you can download for Windows or MacOS from [here](https://www.makerbot.com/3d-printers/apps/makerbot-print/download/).
   * Mobile: the app can be downloaded for Android Or iOS from [here](https://www.makerbot.com/getstarted/).
2. Create an account on MakerBot [website](https://accounts.makerbot.com/register?theme=store) if you don't have already.
3. Connect to MakerBot via USB, ETHERNET or WI-FI.
   * To connect via USB cable, insert the USB-B end of the cable into the port on the back of your MakerBot Replicator+ and insert the USB-A end of the cable into a USB port on your computer. MakerBot Print will detect your MakerBot Replicator
   * To connect via Ethernet, connect an Ethernet cable to your MakerBot Replicator+ and to a wall jack or router. In MakerBot Print, navigate to the Printer Panel and select Add a Printer > Add a Network Printer. Find your MakerBot Replicator+ in the list of networked devices and click Add. Press the dial on the MakerBot Replicator+ to authenticate the connection
   * To connect via Wi-Fi, in MakerBot Print, navigate to the Printer Panel and select Add a Printer > Add a Network Printer. Find your MakerBot Replicator+ in the list of networked devices and click Add. Press the dial on the MakerBot Replicator+ to authenticate the connection
   * To transfer files via USB drive, insert a USB drive into the port next to the dial, select Print > USB Storageand select the desired file. The menu will prompt you to print, transfer the file to onboard memory, or dele

### Printing
1. Open MakerBot print app.
2. Choose a 3D model
   * To open an object from your local computer, open the Project Panel, click Add Models, and navigate to the location of the saved file. Select the file and click Open to import it into MakerBot Print. You can also click File > Insert File to import the object into MakerBot Print. Once a model has been added, it is available to be used on your build plate
3. When you are ready to print your model, click Print in MakerBot Print to slice the model using the current settings and send a .makerbot  print file to your MakerBot Replicator+.
4. You will be reminded to clear the build plate and asked to initiate the print on the control panel.
5. You can also select Begin Printing on the control panel after starting the file transfer or tap Print on the MakerBot Mobile App.
   * If MakerBot Print is connected to your MakerBot Replicator+, the print file will be sent directly to your 3D printer.
   * If MakerBot Print is not connected to your MakerBot Replicator+, this button will open a dialog allowing you to export and save a .makerbot print file. You can transfer the print file to your MakerBot Replicator+ using a USB drive.
6. Click Show Print Preview in MakerBot Print to open a preview of the sliced model. If you so choose, you can have your object printed on a raft. The raft acts as a base for your object and any support structures and ensures that everything adheres well to the build plate. The raft will be easily removable once you detach your finished object from the build plate

### Pausing Or Cancelling a Print
+ To pause a print, push the menu button on the MakerBot Replicator+ and select Pause with the dial. You can also select the printer in MakerBot Print and select Pause.
+ To cancel a print, push the menu button on the MakerBot Replicator+ and select Cancel with the dial. You can also select the printer in MakerBot Print and select Cancel

### After Printing

#### Removing the print from the build plate
When your print finishes, remove the flexible build plate from the MakerBot Replicator+. Remove the print from the build plate by simply bending the flexible build plate. The print will peel off the smooth grip surface. Peel the raft off of the bottom of the print, if you printed the object with a raft. When you have removed the print from the build plate, make sure to clean the build plate of any debris before reloading the build plate into the MakerBot Replicator+. Note: When you bend the flexible build plate, some pieces of the raft may remain on the plate. Simply bend the flex build plate again or use a flat, non-sharp tool to remove the raft pieces. Never use a knife to remove pieces of the raft. You can damage the build plate.
